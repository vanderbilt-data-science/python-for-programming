    "\n",
    "As of version 0.13 (released January 2014), Pandas includes some experimental tools that allow you to directly access C-speed operations without costly allocation of intermediate arrays.\n",
    "These are the ``eval()`` and ``query()`` functions, which rely on the [Numexpr](https://github.com/pydata/numexpr) package.\n",
    "In this notebook we will walk through their use and give some rules-of-thumb about when you might think about using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can rewrite many of the above methods using strings in combination with query if they're operating on the columns of the dataframe.  This helps with speed and performance since temporary intermediate variables are not created, and also helps with readability.  Let's see how this would look below."
